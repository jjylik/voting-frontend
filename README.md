# voting-frontend

> Example frontend project

## Prerequisites

Install node
https://nodejs.org/en/

Setup a locally running backend
https://github.com/markolenkkeri/voting-backend

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

If you see a blank page, make sure that http://localhost:8080/candidate is returning data (backend is running)
